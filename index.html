        <div class="para">
            Viraj is a famous fashion photographer with his own studio in Mumbai with his six-year-old daughter Mahi, with cystic fibrosis. Curious about her mother, Mahi earns her story's promise from her father if she tops her class, but Viraj delays telling it, causing a rift. Mahi goes missing but is saved by Yashna. Both Yashna and Mahi force Viraj to tell the story of Varsha. Viraj recalls falling in love with Varsha in Coonoor. They marry, but Varsha's aversion to parenthood due to her parents failed relationship and divorce, strains their relationship. Mahi's birth reveals her cystic fibrosis, leading to further strain and regret from Varsha for marrying Viraj and conceiving Mahi. Here, a tearful Mahi requests Viraj to stop telling the story. Later, Viraj tells to Yashna that the couple gets into an accident while arguing.
            After the accident erases Varsha's memories, Varsha's mother makes Viraj leave her along with Mahi. It is later revealed that Varsha is none other than Yashna, and Viraj has narrated the story with her name as Varsha to throw her off the scent. Mahi's and Yashna's bond starts to strengthen and Viraj, sensing this and fearing the return of the memories of her past which hurt her deeply, decides to go on an impromptu trip to Goa. Yashna plans Mahi's birthday in Goa, uncovering Viraj's forgetfulness. As a result, fights and emotional sequences result. Mahi, Pluto, Viraj and Yashna share a fleeting but cherished moment together. As Yashna's wedding approaches, Mahi yearns for Yashna's promised surprise. Feeling a true connection, Yashna confesses her love to Viraj, but Viraj, minding the promise he made in the past and fearful of hurting Varsha again, rejects her before her wedding begins. Mahi learns the truth about Yashna from a angered Varsha's mother, which prompts Viraj to angrily make a scene and warn her.
            Unfortunately before the wedding, Mahi has a recurrence of cystic fibrosis symptoms and is rushed to a nearby hospital. However, the doctors say that she has a very little survival chance to Viraj, making him anxious and tense. During the wedding, Yashna's father (who has been living with Viraj this entire time and is now revealed) interrupts and talks to Yashna about whether she really wants this marriage, motivating her to fight harder for her love and informing her of Mahi's situation. Calling the wedding off with her fiancée Araving's consent (the surgeon who saved Yashna from the coma originally), immediately rushes to the hospital to see him and Mahi. Mahi is currently in need of a lung transplant to save and protect her. Yashna's fiancée Aravind comes to know about her diagnosis and empathizes with her. Aravind, along with his physician friends, performs an operation to save Mahi that has a supposed 1% success probability, reigniting the hope within Viraj. The surgery is successfully completed and Mahi survives. Viraj and Yashna reconcile. The film ends with a grown-up Mahi singing a song about her life in front of an audience.
